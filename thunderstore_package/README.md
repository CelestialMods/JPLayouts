# MM Recomp: Japanese Layouts

## Areas

This mod adds the different layouts from the Japanese version of the game.

|                     Area | Changes                                                                                                                                | Mod version |
| -----------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------: |
|              Deku Palace | Multiple grottos and torches were added, and 2 rupees were moves from one side to another                                              |    1.0.0    |
|          Great Bay Coast | The platform below the Marine Research Lab is higher, and required a dolphin dive as Zora to reach it                                  |    1.1.0    |
| Pirate Fortress Interior | The higher floor of the Hookshot room has a nifty shortcut directly to the chest, allowing Link to simply jump down to obtain Hookshot |     N/A     |
|              Stone Tower | The three Elegy Blocks leading to the temple are in a different layout, and the Elegy Switches on the side of the temple are removed   |     N/A     |
|       Stone Tower Temple | The sun switch before the Garo Master room is removed, forcing Deku Mask to be used to get across the air current                      |     N/A     |

> If the mod version shows as `N/A`, it means it isn't yet implmented, but is planned!
